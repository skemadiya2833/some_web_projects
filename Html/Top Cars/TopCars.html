	<h1>#1</h1>
	<h2>Lexus LFA – 552bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="1.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>Proof of how wild and fantastical the power outputs of naturally aspirated cars have got in recent years comes in the form of the LFA, which is the first in a 20-strong list.While its 552bhp may put it on par with Ferrari’s softest car – the turbocharged California T – the LFA’s engine is one of the greatest in history. Peak power arrives at 8,700rpm, by which point the inertia-free 4.8-litre V10 will be shrieking away with a noise the LFA’s chief engineer described as “the roar of an angel.”</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#2</h1>
	<h2>Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera – 562bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="2.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>The LFA may be an all-time great, dripping with glamour, but it’s pipped by a Gallardo.
	It’s a Lamborghini of course, so there’s no great shame in that. The Gallardo may have been Lambo at its most accessible, but by the end of its ten-year life, it was pumping out proper power.The Superleggera, Super Trofeo and Performante special editions all had 562bhp versions of the Gallardo’s V10, which produced a barely less potent 552bhp as standard. Top speed just edged over the magic double-tonne, at 202mph.”</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#3</h1>
	<h2>Caparo T1 – 575bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="3.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>In a sea of Ferraris, Astons and Lambos, we’d forgive you for not quite remembering the T1. Looking like a Formula 1 car for the road, its weeny 3.5-litre V8 engine turned out an unlikely 575bhp. And with fewer than 700 kilos to shift, it endowed the more than mildly frightening T1 with a 205mph top speed and a circa-3.0sec 0-60mph time. We’d advise holding on tight.</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#4</h1>
	<h2>Aston Martin Vantage GT12 – 595bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="4.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>Another British made car, only one with, y’know, a roof and doors and stuff. The Vantage GT12 – the most powerful of a handful of different V12 Vantage models, all of them naturally aspirated – is barely any less wild, though. Just look at its wing. And its utter disdain for rear grip. You need £250,000 to bag one, but that actually makes it cheaper than Caparos were new…</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#5</h1>
	<h2>Ferrari 458 Speciale – 597bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="5.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>The regular 458 Italia – with its 562bhp peak – would be strong enough to make this list. But then, in its twilight years, Ferrari turfed out all the luxury items, stiffened the suspension, and ignited its 4.5-litre N/A V8 just a little bit more. The Speciale’s near-600bhp peak arrives at an almost deafening 9,000rpm. What resulted was one of the greatest modern supercars, one of the best Ferraris ever, and, alongside the new F12 tdf, a go-to example as to why nat-asp engines will always excite more than turbos.</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#6</h1>
	<h2>Lamborghini Huracan/Audi R8 V10 Plus – 602bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="6.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>While Ferrari replaced the 458 with the twin-turbocharged 488, Lamborghini has managed to buck the trend and keep its smallest supercar traditionally powered. A 5.2-litre V10 remains the engine of choice, this time nudging over the 600bhp mark. There’s no longer a manual version, though, a twin-clutch paddleshift gearbox developed with Audi taking its place. And there's significance in that: the setup appears in the uppermost version of the second-generation R8, too.</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#7</h1>
	<h2>Porsche Carrera GT – 604bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="7.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>File this alongside the LFA and Speciale as one of the all-time greats. The CGT uses a 5.7-litre V10 engine which only just loses out to the 911 GT2 RS – Porsche’s most potent turbo car – by 7bhp. It’s arguably as senior, too, with a reputation for spikiness that means only the confident and adept should consider grappling with it. But with a majestic V10 operating through a lovely old-school manual ‘box – complete with wooden gearknob – there are few experiences like it. Not least because its roof panel flips out to pour the noise directly into your ears.</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#8</h1>
	<h2>Maserati MC12 – 621bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="8.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>The Enzo’s more racecar cousin, the MC12 used essentially the same 6.0-litre V12 powertrain, just detuned a smidge. You’d hardly call 621bhp measly, though, and it’s enough to propel the bewinged Maser to 205mph via a 3.8sec 0-60mph time. Want one? You’ll need at least a million quid...</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#9</h1>
	<h2>Mercedes SLS AMG Black Series – 622bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="9.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>Merc’s wonderful old 6.2-litre V8 used to power just about every AMG going, but time – and the inevitable switch to turbocharging – got the better of it. The current AMG GT uses a 4.0-litre forced induction engine, but its predecessor bowed out in mesmerising fashion, via the vehemently naturally aspirated SLS Black Series. With 622bhp, it was a full 60bhp up on standard, and it looked for all the world like an SLS GT3 racer with the stickers removed. And yes, it did like to go sideways…</p>


	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h1>#10</h1>
	<h2>McLaren F1 - 627bhp</h2>
	<img width="725px" src="10.jpg" alt="Image here">
	<p>McLaren’s road car range now entirely revolves around twin-turbo engines, namely various tunes of a 3.8-litre V8 that kick off at 540bhp. McLaren’s first road car, though, the utterly iconic F1, used no such measures to create its power, instead using a BMW-sourced V12. 6.1 litres in size and naturally aspirated, its 627bhp helped the welterweight F1 achieve its 241mph production car speed record that stood until the Bugatti Veyron’s arrival. It came in a few iterations, the ‘longtail’ GT above perhaps the prettiest, and the inspiration for the excellent McLaren 675LT. Good as it may be, though, its twin-turbo engine will never sing with the voice of its ancestor…</p>
